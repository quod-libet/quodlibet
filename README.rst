An audio library, manager & player
----------------------------------

`Quod Libet <https://quodlibet.readthedocs.io>`_
is an audio / music management program.
It provides several different ways to view your audio library,
as well as support for streaming audio and feeds (e.g. podcasts).
It has extremely flexible metadata editing and searching capabilities.

Ex Falso is a tag editor with the same editing interface as Quod Libet.
